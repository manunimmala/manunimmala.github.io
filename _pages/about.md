Hi, my name is Manu Nimmala! I recently in the Engineering Mechanics program, currently within the Mechanical Engineering Department at Virginia Tech. I am fortunate to be co-advised by Dr. Shane Ross ([Ross Dynamics Lab](https://ross.aoe.vt.edu)) and Dr. Hosein Foroutan ([AIRFlowS Lab](https://www.airflows.cee.vt.edu)). My research is focused on understanding the transport of pollen through the atmosphere in varying wind conditions.
