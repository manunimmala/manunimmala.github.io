I already use Notion extensively just to keep track of my research and ideas. I have a pretty free-flowing approach where I just create date-ordered pages filled with links, quotes, and images to collect my thoughts as I work. I thought an easy way to get started would be to just post these working documents publicly and link to them on my academic website here. I can edit them as I make progress and they are automatically updated here live.
